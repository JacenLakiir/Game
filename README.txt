README: Game
===============================

Name: Eric Mercer (ewm10)

Started:  3/21/12
Finished: 3/28/12

Project Length:
- 20 hours [Actual]
- 10 hours [Estimated]

Estimate evaluation:
- I seriously underestimated how much time it would take to assemble a working game in GTGE due to the amount of time I needed to spend reading through the API to figure out how to do various things. Coding the physics via collision reactions was also problematic.

Discussed with:
- no one

Resources:
- GTGE library (http://code.google.com/p/gtge/)

- "sound1.wav" (GTGE tutorial resources)
- "background.jpg" (http://photosinbox.com/backgrounds/metal-plate-background)
- "hero_spritesheet.png" (http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-animations)
- "tile_sprite sheet.png" (http://wecreategames.com/blog/?p=321)
- "skeleton_spritesheet.png" (http://wiki.themanaworld.org/index.php/User:Fother/Pixel_Art)
- three midi files (http://www.sonicscene.net/media/music/midi/genesis/Sonic%20&%20Knuckles/)

Files Used to Start and Test:
- none

Data / Resource Files Required:
- golden_0_2_3 JAR

Impressions:

This was a really fun but challenging project. Reading through an extensive library, especially when written by non-native English speakers, makes it difficult at times to find the features one is searching for. It also showcased some of the weaknesses of Golden T with regard to building 2D platformers, which will hopefully all be addressed by my group's final project.

NOTE:

Collisions are inherently buggy no matter how well I try to prevent blocks from becoming porous or characters getting stuck near blocks. Also, music does not always load and play and bullets do not always work for reasons unknown.
